## Introduction

This project utilizes the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to analyze and visualize global terrorism incidents from 1970 to 2017. The aim is to gain insights into patterns, trends, and key factors associated with terrorist activities worldwide.

## Project Summary

In this project, we explore the GTD, perform data analysis, and create visualizations to understand the scope, causes, and impacts of terrorism. The analysis covers various aspects such as the total number of attacks, kills, top attacking groups, and regional patterns.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the need to comprehensively study terrorism, understand its complex factors, and develop strategies to mitigate its negative effects. It emphasizes interdisciplinary research to tackle the multifaceted nature of terrorism.

## Business Objectives

The main business objectives include ensuring the safety and security of stakeholders, minimizing the impact of terrorism-related incidents, complying with regulations, protecting the company's reputation, and contributing to a safer global environment.

## Libraries Used

The project utilizes the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Folium

## Data Loading and Exploration

The dataset is loaded from Google Drive using Google Colab. Initial exploratory data analysis includes checking for duplicates, missing values, and understanding variable distributions.

## Data Analysis and Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations, such as:
- Number of attacks and kills per year
- Top 10 attacking groups
